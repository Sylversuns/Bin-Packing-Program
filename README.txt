This was an assignment for one of my classes.
The bin packing problem (fitting x items with given weights into y boxes) is NP-complete.
The program is a greedy approximation algorithm, and illustrates how quicksorting first makes it more efficient.
Please see the comments at the top of the .cpp file for a more detailed explanation of how it works.
There is also a PDF file with the original assignment prompt for reference.
